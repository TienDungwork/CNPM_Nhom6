## 📊 **DATA ARCHITECTURE**

### **Data Separation Model:**

```
ADMIN CONTENT (Source of Truth)
├── Meals (id: 1, 2, 3, 4)
└── Exercises (id: 1, 2, 3, 4)
        ↓ User copies via "Add to My..."
USER CONTENT (Personal Copies)
├── UserMeals (userId: 1, baseMealId: 1)
└── UserExercises (userId: 1, baseExerciseId: 1)
```

**Key Principles:**
1. ✅ Admin creates meals/exercises → stored in `Meals` and `Exercises`
2. ✅ User copies to personal collection → stored in `UserMeals` and `UserExercises`
3. ✅ User edits their copy → only `UserMeals`/`UserExercises` updated
4. ✅ Admin edits original → only `Meals`/`Exercises` updated
5. ✅ Complete data isolation between admin and user modifications
